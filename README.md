Instructions on Filtering Out Profanity in Uncharted 4

I really enjoyed Uncharted 4 for PC (Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, with The Lost Legacy). However, the profanity was rather aggravating. Unfortunately there aren't any mods or helpful informatino online about dealing with it, other than this "helpful" [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/uncharted/comments/ci67b4/profanity_filter/) post. I decided to take things into my own hands. Removing profanity from the game follows the basic process of unpack the PS archive, convert the audio files, filter out the profanity, and then reverse the whole process.
